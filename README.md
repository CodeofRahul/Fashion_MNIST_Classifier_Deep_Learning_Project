# Fashion_MNIST_Classifier_Deep_Learning_Project
This project demonstrates building and training a standard, fully connected Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The Fashion-MNIST dataset is like a more complex version of the classic MNIST dataset, containing images of clothing items like shirts, trousers, and shoes instead of handwritten digits.
